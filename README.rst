Clinic EDC
==========

``Clinic EDC`` contains complete code for a set of core modules for clinical trial data management to build a trial EDC. Refer to the specific open projects listed below for example EDC systems built with these modules. The codebase continues to evolve over many years of conducting clinical trials for mostly NIH-funded clinical trials through the `Harvard T Chan School of Public Health <https://aids.harvard.edu>`__, the `Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership <https://aids.harvard.edu/research/bhp>`__ in Gaborone, Botswana and the `London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine <https://lshtm.ac.uk>`__. Almost all trials have been related to HIV/AIDS research. Recent work with the `Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine <https://lstm.ac.uk>`__ has expanded into Diabetes (DM), Hypertension (HTN) and models of integrating care in Africa (https://inteafrica.org) for the three main chronic conditions -- HIV/DM/HTN. 


The ``Clinic EDC`` for each trial consists of a subset of trial-specific modules that reference this module.

(python 3.8 and Django 3.0+ required, see requirements.txt)
