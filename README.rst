Clinic EDC
==========

The ``Clinic EDC`` contains code for the core clinical trial data management system modules for our "edc". The codebase has evolved over many years of conducting clinical trials for mostly NIH-funded clinical trials at the [Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership](https://aids.harvard.edu/research/bhp) in Gaborone, Botswana. Almost all trials were related to HIV/AIDS research.

The ``Clinic EDC`` for each trial consists of a subset of trial-specific modules that reference this module.

(python 3.7 and Django 2.2+ required)
